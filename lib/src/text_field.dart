part of "../customized_keyboard.dart";

/// Creates a Material Design text field that works with custom keyboards.
///
/// It behaves the same as [TextField] but accepts [CustomTextInputType] as
/// well as [TextInputType] as [keyboardType].
///
/// A text field lets the user enter text, either with hardware keyboard or with
/// an onscreen keyboard.
///
/// The text field calls the [onChanged] callback whenever the user changes the
/// text in the field. If the user indicates that they are done typing in the
/// field (e.g., by pressing a button on the soft keyboard), the text field
/// calls the [onSubmitted] callback.
///
/// To control the text that is displayed in the text field, use the
/// [controller]. For example, to set the initial value of the text field, use
/// a [controller] that already contains some text. The [controller] can also
/// control the selection and composing region (and to observe changes to the
/// text, selection, and composing region).
///
/// By default, a text field has a [decoration] that draws a divider below the
/// text field. You can use the [decoration] property to control the decoration,
/// for example by adding a label or an icon. If you set the [decoration]
/// property to null, the decoration will be removed entirely, including the
/// extra padding introduced by the decoration to save space for the labels.
///
/// If [decoration] is non-null (which is the default), the text field requires
/// one of its ancestors to be a [Material] widget.
///
/// To integrate the [TextField] into a [Form] with other [FormField] widgets,
/// consider using [TextFormField].
///
/// {@template flutter.material.textfield.wantKeepAlive}
/// When the widget has focus, it will prevent itself from disposing via its
/// underlying [EditableText]'s [AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin.wantKeepAlive] in
/// order to avoid losing the selection. Removing the focus will allow it to be
/// disposed.
/// {@endtemplate}
///
/// Remember to call [TextEditingController.dispose] of the [TextEditingController]
/// when it is no longer needed. This will ensure we discard any resources used
/// by the object.
///
/// {@tool snippet}
/// This example shows how to create a [TextField] that will obscure input. The
/// [InputDecoration] surrounds the field in a border using [OutlineInputBorder]
/// and adds a label.
///
/// ![](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/material/text_field.png)
///
/// ```dart
/// const TextField(
///   obscureText: true,
///   decoration: InputDecoration(
///     border: OutlineInputBorder(),
///     labelText: 'Password',
///   ),
/// )
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// ## Reading values
///
/// A common way to read a value from a TextField is to use the [onSubmitted]
/// callback. This callback is applied to the text field's current value when
/// the user finishes editing.
///
/// {@tool dartpad}
/// This sample shows how to get a value from a TextField via the [onSubmitted]
/// callback.
///
/// ** See code in examples/api/lib/material/text_field/text_field.1.dart **
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// {@macro flutter.widgets.EditableText.lifeCycle}
///
/// For most applications the [onSubmitted] callback will be sufficient for
/// reacting to user input.
///
/// The [onEditingComplete] callback also runs when the user finishes editing.
/// It's different from [onSubmitted] because it has a default value which
/// updates the text controller and yields the keyboard focus. Applications that
/// require different behavior can override the default [onEditingComplete]
/// callback.
///
/// Keep in mind you can also always read the current string from a TextField's
/// [TextEditingController] using [TextEditingController.text].
///
/// ## Handling emojis and other complex characters
/// {@macro flutter.widgets.EditableText.onChanged}
///
/// In the live Dartpad example above, try typing the emoji 👨‍👩‍👦
/// into the field and submitting. Because the example code measures the length
/// with `value.characters.length`, the emoji is correctly counted as a single
/// character.
///
/// {@macro flutter.widgets.editableText.showCaretOnScreen}
///
/// {@macro flutter.widgets.editableText.accessibility}
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [TextFormField], which integrates with the [Form] widget.
///  * [InputDecorator], which shows the labels and other visual elements that
///    surround the actual text editing widget.
///  * [EditableText], which is the raw text editing control at the heart of a
///    [TextField]. The [EditableText] widget is rarely used directly unless
///    you are implementing an entirely different design language, such as
///    Cupertino.
